# ECG-to-SCG Signal Transformation using Wavelet CycleGAN

## Overview  
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, visiting hospitals for routine cardiovascular check-ups can be impractical. Fortunately, wearable devices with **Seismocardiogram (SCG) sensors** enable continuous, non-invasive heart monitoring.  

This project, **"Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Cardiovascular Monitoring Using SCG Signals,"** leverages a **Unified Attentive Cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to:  
- Convert SCG signals into ECG signals (and vice versa)  
- Improve the quality of SCG signals using **Wavelet Transformations**  
- Detect critical metrics like **heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and arrhythmias**  
- Enhance **smartwatch-based heart monitoring** for real-time alerts
