In today's fast-paced world, it's impractical for most people to visit the hospital daily just to check their heart rate or other cardiovascular metrics. However, with advancements in technology, we now have smart gadgets like smartwatches that can help monitor our heart health continuously and conveniently.

My current project, "Deep Learning based approaches for Cardiovascular monitoring using seismocardiogram (SCG) signals," aims to enhance these wearable technologies. We're focusing on learning patterns to synthesize electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from SCG signals, and vice-versa, using a sophisticated model called the Unified Attentive Cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

These smartwatches equipped with SCG sensors can provide continuous and non-invasive monitoring of heart health. By detecting critical metrics such as heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and arrhythmias, these devices can alert users to potential health issues in real-time.

My Role in the Project
As part of this cutting-edge research, my role focuses on developing and optimizing the GAN architecture for SCG-to-ECG signal conversion. Specifically:

✅ Wavelet Transformation & Signal Processing – I apply wavelet transformations to denoise and enhance SCG signals, ensuring that only meaningful features are extracted. This step is critical for improving signal quality before feeding data into our deep learning models.

✅ GAN Model Optimization – I work on refining the Unified Attentive Cyclic GAN, which allows seamless bi-directional conversion between ECG and SCG signals while maintaining signal integrity.

✅ Ensuring High-Fidelity Data – By applying advanced cycle-consistency loss functions and multi-scale discriminators, I help improve the model’s accuracy, ensuring that the generated signals closely match real-world ECG data.

Through this work, we're advancing the field of wearable heart monitoring—making AI-driven cardiac health tracking more accessible, reliable, and efficient.

Additionally, I was also handling a bit of the pre-processing of SCG signals to ensure the data is of high quality before it is fed into our deep learning models. I use wavelet transformation to clean and transform the raw SCG data, highlighting essential features and reducing noise. This step is crucial for accurate signal analysis.
